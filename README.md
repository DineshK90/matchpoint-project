This is my fullstack booking project MatchPoint.

It is an eSports themed booking site where users can create events and join events.

CRUD functionality is implemented to allow creation, viewing, updating and deleting of events.

With the intergration of Firebase, image upload for banners is also available + user authentication.

User flow allows any user to view all events, however filtered to allow only the organiser to view participants and approve for private events. Site admin has full control over all aspects.

Future implementation includes Google Calendar syncing with email reminders. Reject functionality for join requests are also to be added. Another feature I would like to see implemented would be tournament brackets for tournament hosting > team signup.
